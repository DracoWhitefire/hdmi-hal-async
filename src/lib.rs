//! Async hardware abstraction traits for the HDMI stack.
//!
//! `hdmi-hal-async` is the async companion to `hdmi-hal`, following the same split as
//! `embedded-hal` / `embedded-hal-async`. It mirrors each trait in `hdmi-hal` with
//! `async fn` methods and otherwise identical signatures. Like `hdmi-hal`, it holds traits
//! and the glue between its own traits (the `Send` twins' blanket implementations,
//! [`scdc::read_block_bytewise`], [`scdc::ScdcOverDdc`], [`scdc::SendScdcOverDdc`]): no
//! hardware, platform or clock implementations, no policy.
//!
//! Each trait also has a `Send` twin, [`phy::SendFrlPhy`], [`phy::SendTmdsPhy`],
//! [`phy::SendPhyPower`], [`scdc::SendScdcTransport`], [`ddc::SendDdcBus`] and
//! [`time::SendDelay`], for code that spawns work on a multi-threaded executor: the same
//! methods, returning futures that are `Send`. Every twin implementation is an
//! implementation of the plain trait as well.

#![no_std]
#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
// async fn in traits does not guarantee Send on the returned futures. This is intentional
// for the plain traits: they serve single-threaded embedded executors (e.g. Embassy), where
// Send is not required, the same decision embedded-hal-async made. The Send twins
// (SendFrlPhy, SendTmdsPhy, SendPhyPower, SendScdcTransport, SendDdcBus, SendDelay) are for multi-threaded executors.
